/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.
 *
 * The line below will require recursively all files inside 'app/assets/stylesheets': 
 *= require_tree .
 *
 * In the line below we are requiring Bootstrap inside the 'application.css' from 
 * 'vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.css':
 *= require bootstrap
 *
 * The line below will require all styles we add in this stylesheet: 
 *= require_self
